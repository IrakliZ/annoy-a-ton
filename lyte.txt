We have a zero tolerance policy against hate speech, racism, homophobia, and sexism and that policy stands whether you're a random player, a pro player, or a Youtube celebrity.
It makes the experience worse for everyone else in the game.
We know that players have been asking us to be more aggressive against intentional feeders for awhile.
This is a great first step to aggressively tackling intentional feeders.
At the end of the day, this incident sucks for everyone.
We'll be taking a look at all intentional feeding situations and handing out permanent bans if they are ruining gameplay experiences for players who do NOT want to be involved in this.
Most players in-game aren't jerks, so they have nothing to fear.
In the real world, none of this stuff is OK and it doesn't mean people are thin skinned or sensitive.
The vast majority of players in League hate these types of behaviors
It looks like your chat restriction was deserved... :(
World class teams don't get where they are by being shitty to their teammates.
If you troll intentionally you'll just be escalated to a permanent ban.
In saying this, looking at the data, "GGEZ" is considered a negative term, and is reportable.
It might have been OK in online games or forums in the past, but that doesn't make it OK forever.
We're here to play a game and have fun, and some of us might be more competitive than others and play to win.
Let's be fair here.
Nothing worthwhile in life is easy to accomplish ;) Keep at it!
It's OK to fail. We all do, and it's one of the most important lessons of our lives.
That was the moment that I realized that genius or intelligence can't carry you in life.
